## Visual Design Tactics

### Hierarchy & Focus
- **Best value package stands out** (gradient, border, badge)
- Smaller text = less visual clutter = faster decision
- White space guides eye to CTAs
- Checkmarks (✓) are faster to scan than bullets

### Trust Elements Position
- Stats at top (immediate credibility)
- Guarantee near pricing (reduces purchase anxiety)
- Testimonials between pricing and FAQ (social proof at decision point)
- Free consultation at bottom (last chance to engage)

### Color Psychology
- Purple = creativity, quality, premium
- White CTAs with purple border = less aggressive, inviting
- Purple-filled CTA on best value = confidence to choose
- Gradient on popular option = special treatment

## Copywriting Tactics

### Benefit-Focused
- "land interviews" not "get resume reviewed"
- "3x more callbacks" not "better resume"
- "worth every penny" not "good service"

### Conversational Tone
- "i don't waste your time" (personal, direct)
- "if you're applying to jobs, i can help" (inclusive)
- "brutally honest" (sets expectations, builds trust)

### Action-Oriented
- "get started" not "buy now" (less pressure)
- "book now to secure your slot" (action + urgency)
- "schedule free call" (low commitment ask)

## Mobile Optimization
- Compact cards fit mobile screens
- 3-column grid stacks on mobile
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Faster load = less bounce

## A/B Test Opportunities
1. Test "4 spots left" vs "booking fast"
2. Test price display (with/without strikethrough)
3. Test CTA text ("get started" vs "book now")
4. Test free consultation positioning
5. Test testimonial format (cards vs quotes)

## Conversion Funnel
1. **Awareness**: Trust badges, credentials
2. **Consideration**: Qualifications, social proof
3. **Decision**: Pricing comparison, value anchor
4. **Action**: Clear CTAs, pre-filled emails
5. **Post-decision**: Guarantee, FAQ reduces buyer's remorse
6. **Alternative path**: Free consultation for hesitant buyers

## Metrics to Track
- Email inquiry rate (conversion)
- Package distribution (which sells most)
- Time to decision (how long on page before email)
- Bounce rate on pricing section
- Free consultation requests
- Mobile vs desktop conversion

2. Calendar integration for instant booking
3. Before/after resume examples
4. Video testimonials
5. Case study page for each package
6. Retargeting email sequence
7. Payment link integration (skip email back-and-forth)
8. "People also bought" for upsells
